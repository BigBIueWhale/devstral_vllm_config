# Instructions (verbatim)

> Use /tmp to clone repos. Please gain inspiration from https://github.com/BigBIueWhale/nvidia_nemotron_vllm_config and also from https://github.com/BigBIueWhale/mistral_vibe_setup and from https://github.com/BigBIueWhale/personal_server and from https://github.com/BigBIueWhale/ollama_load_balancer. Create the entire project to my standard (I created all those projects). But first- create a document with my instructions verbatim, within this folder. Go!

> Oh, did I mention to research extensively online **a lot** to get everything right, and not miss anything that you need to do? The task: to create information-generous, and yet full, opinionated well-researched and information-dense, nothing is obvious setup for my PC for Mistral Devstral 2 Small (24b) 4-bit at its maximum context length on my 32 GiB VRAM GPU, for serving Mistral Vibe CLI. Add that to the instructions, then reevaluate your plan.

> Please base everything on what I actually have installed on my PC according to https://github.com/BigBIueWhale/personal_server/. Also, always use full names of things. For example: Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphone instead of Galaxy S25.

> And also, research every aspect online to be sure about what needs to be done, instead of giving the reader options.

> Add these instructions to the readme as well

> Note: I'm talking about **specifically** devstral 2. Not anything else. Not devstral original. Also, make sure everything throughout the entire guide is versioned in addition to using full names. Add that to the instructions as well. Don't make up versions- make sure to research about that as well.
